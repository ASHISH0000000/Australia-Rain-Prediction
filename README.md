In this Project, i've used the following classification algorithms to create a model based on our training
data and evaluate our testing data using various evaluation metrics:


1.Linear Regression
2.KNN
3.Decision Trees
4.Logistic Regression
5.SVM

I evaluate my models by using:
1.Accuracy Score
2.R2-Score



The original source of the data is Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and the latest data can be
gathered from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/.

Definitions adapted from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/IDCJDW0000.shtml

Objective
Predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow by training a binary classification model on target RainTomorrow.
The target variable RainTomorrow means: Did it rain the next day? Yes or No.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data pre-processing and Feature engineering
3. Model the data using Logisitic Regression, Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM
4. Model Evaluation
